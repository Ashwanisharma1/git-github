Allocating a LUN (Logical Unit Number) in an HPE 3PAR storage system involves creating a virtual volume and exporting it to a host or host group. Here's a concise guide to help you:

Steps to Allocate a LUN in HPE 3PAR. 

 

Check the available space using the cmd ‚Äúshowcpg‚Äù 

 

 

2 Create a Virtual Volume (VV) 

Command Line Interface (CLI): 

Copy the code createvv <cpg_name> <volume_name> <size> 

 

Example: 

Copy the code createvv CPG1 MyVolume 100G 

<cpg_name>: The Common Provisioning Group (CPG) where the volume will reside. 

<volume_name>: Name of the virtual volume. 

<size>: Size of the volume (e.g., 100G for 100 GB). 

Management Console (GUI): 

Navigate to Provisioning ‚Üí Virtual Volumes. 

Click Create. 

Fill in the required details (CPG, size, etc.) and save.

2. Export the Virtual Volume to a Host 

CLI: 

Copy the code createvlun <volume_name> <lun_id> <host_name> 

 

Example: 

Copy the codecreatevlun MyVolume 1 MyHost 

<lun_id>: Logical Unit Number (e.g., 1). 

<host_name>: Name of the host to which the LUN is being assigned. 

GUI: 

Go to Hosts ‚Üí Host Sets or Hosts. 

Select the host or host group. 

Click Export Volume and choose the virtual volume. 

Assign a LUN ID and save. 

Shape 

3. Verify the LUN Allocation 

CLI: 

Copy the code showvlun 

This will display all exported volumes and their associated hosts. 

GUI: 

Navigate to Hosts ‚Üí Host Sets or Hosts. 

Check the exported volumes for the selected host. 

Shape 

Additional Notes 

Ensure the host is already configured in the 3PAR system with its WWN or iSCSI IQN. 

Use appropriate CPGs based on performance and storage requirements (e.g., SSD, FC, NL). 

Always double-check the LUN ID to avoid conflicts.
