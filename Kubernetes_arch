Kubernetes comes with client-server architecture. Master being installed on single node and worker on many linux nodes.

Master:
Api Server - The API server is a component of the Kubernetes control plane that exposes the Kubernetes API. 
It is like an initial gateway to the cluster that listens to updates or queries via CLI like Kubectl.
Kubectl communicates with API Server to inform what needs to be done like creating pods or deleting pods etc. 
It also works as a gatekeeper. It generally validates requests received and then forwards them to other processes.
No request can be directly passed to the cluster, 
it has to be passed through the API Server.
